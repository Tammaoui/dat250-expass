## DAT250 Assignment 1

The goal of the assignment was to host a java application on heroku. I achieved this by following the tutorial (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java) step by step and installing the required programs (Heroku CLI, Intellij).
I did not encounter any technical difficulties during installation. The process was painfree and straight to the point. I have validated that the software development environment is running by opening the URL generated by heroku. I have also checked that it is running by opening the dashboard on heroku to see that the app has been deployed. 
I did not encounter any techincal issues with heroku.

The link to the web application is:
